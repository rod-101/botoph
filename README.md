## I created an educational platform for Filipino voters.

### The user (voter) can:
1. create an account.
2. search a candidate by name, position running for, partylist or platform.
3. view candidate pages.
4. edit profile info (only the email).

### The admin can:
1. login (email: admin@gmail.com, pass: 123)
2. add a candidate (only the card)
3. create a page for the candidate
4. edit candidate info
5. delete candidate
6. disable a user's account (unfinished)
7. edit a user's account

### Suggestions:
1. allow commenting on each candidate page
2. add moderators
